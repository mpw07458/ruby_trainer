## Basic Rails learning environment.

This is designed to walk you through building a rails app if you are the kind of person that learns from seeing code. Most of the code works, it is just a matter of getting it to be fully functional and then playing around to see what breaks what.

## Getting Started

Run `bundle`.

Run `rails db:migrate` to set up the postgres db

Run `rake import_csv` to import csv data

Run `rspec`

Run `rails s` to start up the server at localhost:3000
